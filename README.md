## Dictionary Design
The app uses dictionaries to store information. The keys/fields represent the various data attributes, and the corresponding values are strings. When performing computations, typecast the number strings to integers. This data dictionary design is based on the normalization concept in relational databases (discussed in higher CMSC courses).

**Note**: The LAPERA app is a simple console-based application for educational purposes and does not connect to a real database. The data is stored within the program's runtime, and normal database operations are not supported.

To run the LAPERA app, follow the installation steps below:

## Installation
1. Download the LAPERA repository.
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the LAPERA directory.
5. Run the LAPERA Python script.

Thank you for using LAPERA! Happy shopping! üõçÔ∏è
